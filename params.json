PocketJS combines some of the most heavily used jQuery DOM methods into a tiny \"pocket-sized\" 1KB file. (Legal Disclaimer: 1kb AFTER minification. Not guaranteed to fit in your pocket.)\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nTo use, simply include the script anywhere on your page:\r\n```\r\n  <script src=\"pocket.min.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nA list of available methods and example usages of each is located on [Github](https://github.com/callmeaponte/pocketJS).\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2014, Andrew Aponte authored the ridiculously amazingly awesome PocketJS library.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with PocketJS?
